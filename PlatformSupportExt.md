### Part 1: Linux

- Linux x64 Is My Primary Platform, And Will Have The Best Support.

- Other CPU Types For Linux Aren't Supported.

### Part 2: Windows

- Windows x64 Is Mostly Supported, But May Break As I Don't Do Too Vigourous Testing For The Windows Build.

- Other CPU Types For Windows Aren't Supported.

- The Minimum Version Of Windows Supported Is Currently Windows 10.

### Part 3: MacOS

- MacOS x64 & aarch64 Are Partly Supported, But Probably Will Break As My Mac Mini's Install Of MacOS Is Currently **Very Broken**.
